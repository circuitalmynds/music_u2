Carlos Kleiber, while keeping a perfect coherence from the first to the last bar, does not seem to submit to any predictable way of treating the structure of this symphony, which is difficult to handle because of its richness of inspiration. Carlos Kleiber's master stroke is explained by an immense variety of phrasing. The tempo is never set in stone, it can be wide or narrow, serving the most serene or the most tense and dramatic climates. Even under tension, elegance is the order of the day and the Vienna Philharmonic responds to its slightest inflection. This recording was awarded the World Recording Prize.
