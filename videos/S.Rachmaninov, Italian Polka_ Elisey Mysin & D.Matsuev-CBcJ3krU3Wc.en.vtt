00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:13.119
Well, look, Elisey Andreevich, there is a miracle Yudo sitting there, you

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.675
better not go that direction, but we have a stage there, see?

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:20.559
don't see, can't you see? I don't see.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.388
See? Yeah, I see

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:32.125
Vanya, but come with me, help me

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.681
Or I reach either the keys or the pedals

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:40.440
The choice is difficult, well, let's go, I will help

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.867
Well, dear friends, of course when we announced

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:57.453
that in the fabulous season that we are doing together as creators the film "The Last Bogatyr"

00:02:57.453 --> 00:03:04.780
will be attended by guys from previous seasons, many people asked the question: will Elisey Mysin be?

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.293
and here he is on stage

00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:10.987
, you have a lot of interesting things happened, have you now moved from Stavropol to where?

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:14.876
to Moscow, to Moscow, and study at the central music school,

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:22.609
tell me, but your "Mandarin" has already become such a famous work that, as far as I know, you even received copyright for it, right? Yes!

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.800
I can say that I follow this young artist very closely.I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.726
am happy that he studies at the central music school at the conservatory.This

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:42.670
is really a very gifted person, he understands perfectly well, I know that he does not like when he is especially praised when he

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.124
enters here, and flies out of the other ear instantly

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:56.890
because he is very greedy for creativity, he always learns something new, he always composes something

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.831
I wish you good luck and "Mandarin" of course we will play, despite the deductions to copyright

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:09.036
Oleg, well, you remember Elisha 2 years ago

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:13.420
A huge discovery of the Blue Bird

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.537
Happiness that the discovery continues, Elisha is growing both technically and simply in height

00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:27.113
But what is most remarkable for me is that it does not directly lose charm

00:04:27.113 --> 00:04:35.230
and these qualities are inherent in real talent, efficiency, and in at the same time, frankness in creativity

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.639
I wish it to remain for life and thank you very much for today

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:44.598
Elena, well, this is the first time you see Elisha on stage.

00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:53.211
I just know that in connection with the fact that I've never met children like you in my life, well, with such a young man like you

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:59.796
, you can just tell me your daily routine, that's what your day consists of.

00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:07.045
And what are you looking at me? I don’t know what your day is, but it’s probably breakfast, right?

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:16.510
What do you usually eat for breakfast? Well, eat an omelet? porridge? Omelet and porridge.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:25.541
How much piano do you play a day? It happens at 8, 4, 2 hours,

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:33.481
and when do you play with toys? He plays the piano. Do you draw, and when do you read?

00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:35.481
When you and Denis go to a concert, he probably reads you a book on the plane))

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:55.325
They have a childhood, they just have a different tempo and rhythm. They all have time and go to school, but it's not every day for 8 hours, though Elisha, tell me

00:05:55.325 --> 00:06:01.691
It's absolutely brilliant, Elisha is not conceited, this is an amazing quality when works, work, this is the most important thing

00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:03.101
Elisha is capable

00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:06.248
Awesome by the way, that would be a wonderful duet

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:13.775
Here is Sergei, a great idea, because it also came to my mind when Elisey was playing,

00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:20.667
because Denis, you have now perfectly celebrated Rokhmaninov's birthday by playing 5 of his concerts.

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:29.311
And now his work was also played, maybe we will continue to celebrate? Maybe you and Elisha are a little bit Polka, we love your duet so much.

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:31.156
Let's try

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:48.846
How fast you run Dinis. The Spartak team has a replacement: Denis Matsuev plays instead of Medyanik's orchestra.

00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:59.284
Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninov: "Polka" performed by: Denis Matsuev and Elisey Mysin

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:08.303
I will repeat again the phrase I said after that "Mandarin": You can travel around the country with this number !!!

00:08:08.798 --> 00:08:19.853
You should have seen Elena Yakovleva, she moved Oleg Pogudin there from the other end, it seemed to her that it would be better to see there, then she almost fell out

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:24.470
I wanted to see 4 ingenious hands, and I saw them

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.970
A few questions for the great pianist:

00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:32.027
Denis, is your name? ))

00:08:32.027 --> 00:08:33.795
Please tell me, how are you?

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:35.487
I'm from Irkutsk

00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:40.710
. How many hours a day do you play music?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.802
I mainly play football, but my dad and mom make me ...

00:08:44.802 --> 00:08:47.844
To act in films, in "Bogatyr"?

00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:52.896
I want to go to "Bogatyr", but they won't take me, I stayed in the Blue Bird for the third year already))

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:02.759
Thank you for inviting me, I really love this program, my parents and I watch it

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:06.342
Bogatyr Ivan and Bogatyr Denis

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:09.633
Thank you very much!

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:13.386
This will be a worthy continuation of the tale, thank you very much
