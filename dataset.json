        "description": "THERE`S SOMETHING IN THE AIR was recorded by Ray Noble 1936  and the vocals were by Al Bowlly.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL VIDEO FOOTAGE CAN BE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING LINKS :\n\nAL BOWLLY can be found here...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr4ncMR5EVQ&t=2s\n\nAND HERE...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRF5D68e44Q\n\nThe RAY NOBLE ORCHESTRA can be found here...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-09_fAUSk\n\nAND HERE...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icl4xICJgcA\n\nNAT GONELLA CAN BE FOUND HERE...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FqxPVXU8Cw&list=PLbZ5buaADkXO87Zvt68AEdqfDCKdCGRP0&index=4&t=0s\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBowlly was born in Louren\u00e7o Marques in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. His parents were Greek and Lebanese. They met en route to Australia and moved to South Africa.\n\nBowlly was brought up in Johannesburg.After a series of odd jobs across South Africa, including barber and jockey, he sang in a dance band led by Edgar Adeler on a tour of South Africa, Rhodesia, India, and Indonesia during the mid-1920s. He was fired from the band in Surabaya, Indonesia.\n\nJimmy Liquime hired him to sing with the band in India and Singapore In 1927 Bowlly made his first record, a cover version of \"Blue Skies\" by Irving Berlin that was recorded with Adeler in Berlin, Germany. During the next year, he worked in London, England, with the orchestra of Fred Elizalde.\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression in 1929 resulted in Bowlly being made redundant and returning to several months of busking to survive. In the 1930s, he signed two contracts\u2014one in May 1931 with Roy Fox, singing in his live band for the Monseigneur Restaurant in London, the other a record contract with bandleader Ray Noble in November 1930.\n\nDuring the next four years, he recorded over 500 songs. By 1933 Lew Stone had ousted Fox as bandleader, and Bowlly was singing Stone's arrangements with Stone's band. After much radio exposure and a successful British tour with Stone, Bowlly was inundated with demands for appearances and gigs\u2014including undertaking a solo British tour\u2014but continued to make most of his recordings with Noble. There was considerable competition between Noble and Stone for Bowlly's time. For much of the year, Bowlly spent all day in the recording studio with Noble's band, rehearsing and recording, then the evening with Stone's band at the Monseigneur. Many of these recordings with Noble were issued in the United States by Victor, which meant that by the time Noble and Bowlly came to America, their reputation had preceded them.\n\nHe performed in England with his band, the Radio City Rhythm Makers But by 1937 the band broke up when vocal problems were traced to a wart in his throat, briefly causing him to lose his voice. Separated from his wife, and with his band dissolved, he borrowed money from friends and traveled to New York City for surgery.\n\nHis absence from the UK in the early 1930s damaged his popularity with British audiences, despite his association with pianist Monia Liter as his accompanist. His career began to suffer as a result of problems with his voice, which affected the frequency of his recordings. He played a few small parts in films, but the parts were often cut and scenes that were shown were brief. Noble was offered a role in Hollywood, although the offer excluded Bowlly because a singer had already been hired. Bowlly moved back to London with his wife Marjie in January 1937.\n\nWith diminished success in Britain, he toured regional theatres and recorded as often as possible to make a living, moving from orchestra to orchestra, working with Sydney Lipton, Gerald Bright and Ken \"Snakehips\" Johnson. In 1940 there was a revival of interest in his career when he worked in a duo with Jimmy Messene in Radio Stars with Two Guitars on the London stage. It was his last venture before his death in April 1941. The partnership was uneasy. Messene had a drinking problem. When he showed up for work, he was occasionally unable to perform. Bowlly recorded his last song two weeks before his death. It was a duet with Messene of Irving Berlin's satirical song about Hitler, \"When That Man is Dead and Gone\".\n\nI have used footage of the Ray Noble Orchestra from when they were touring Holland in 1934,  from what I am aware this is the only footage of them publicly available.  Footage of Al Bowlly was taken from Pathe News and later footage of Ray Noble was taken from an American TV series from 1948 called \"Merry Go Round\".  full videos can be seen on the BRITISH PATHE channel (Thank you British Pathe)\n\nPlease LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE TO THIS CHANNEL if you like my videos.",

Carlos Kleiber's master stroke is explained by an immense variety of phrasing. The tempo is never set in stone, it can be wide or narrow, serving the most serene or the most tense and dramatic climates. Even under tension, elegance is the order of the day and the Vienna Philharmonic responds to its slightest inflection.

        "description": "Echo And The Bunnymen \u2022 Show of Strength \u2022 1981\n\n\u2022\n\nThis video is a new edit of rare footage of Echo And The Bunnymen in 1982, appearing on a Dutch TV show called G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung 2000. \n\nOn the 23rd of July 1982, Echo and the Bunnymen played a show at the Paradiso, in Amsterdam, so in all likelihood the band\u2019s appearance on G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung 2000 was on or around that day. \n\nOn the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung 2000 appearance, the band mimed to a playback of studio versions of new song Heads Will Roll, and Show of Strength, All My Colours and Over The Wall from the Heaven Up Here album, which had been released in May of the previous year. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u201cI came in right on cue\u201d\n\nBack in the day, I loved the debut Echo And The Bunnymen album, Crocodiles. It\u2019s an album of short, sharp songs with catchy hooks and choruses, and bright bouncy production by The Chameleons AKA Bill Drummond & David Balfe. Pretty much the same sound they had also lent to The Teardrop Explodes debut album, Kilimanjaro that year. \n\nThe follow-up album to Crocodiles was hugely anticipated by me. I went into Croydon to buy my copy the day it was released in May 1981. Going home on the bus, I poured over every detail of the record sleeve. I would soon discover that the grim wintery indigo sleeve art suited the new sound; Heaven Up Here was a very different proposition to its predecessor. The Chameleons production team was out, and in was Hugh Jones. Bright and bouncy and catchy was replaced by a dark, cold, funky sophistication and pounding drums high upfront in the mix . In the book Rip It Up and Start Again... Simon Reynolds described the sound of Heaven Up Here as having been filled out with \"guitar overdubs, keyboard glints, vocal multitracking and atmospheric vapours\". Comparing Heaven Up Here with Joy Division's 1980 album Closer, Reynolds said they are \"harrowed by the same things - hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential\".\n\nI was not disappointed; Heaven Up Here became my favorite new album and The Bunnymen became my favorite new band. Towards the end of 1981, I saw them for the first time, at the Hammersmith Palais in London. I was 14 years old, and the show was sublime. Barny Hoskyns reviewed the show the following day in Liverpool, in the NME concluded, \u201d\u2026currently the most urgent and accomplished live performance you\u2019re likely to see\u201d.  \n\nHeaven Up Here remains for me Echo And The Bunnymen\u2019s finest hour, and one of the greatest rock albums of all time. And album opener, Show of Strength, is simply a masterpiece.\n\n\u2022\n\nOn the original clip, some of the miming wasn\u2019t great and moreover some of the original editing really sucked. So in addition to the usual scrub-up and syncing to a decent audio source, I\u2019ve also reedited the clip. \n\nHope you dig it! \n\n\u2022\n\nHuge thanks for sending me the original file of the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung 2000 show:\n\nwww.youtube.com/user/TravisBickle1963\n \n\u2022\n\nCredits\n\nVideo Source:\nEcho And The Bunnymen \u2022 Show of Strength \u2022 Performed on the Dutch TV show G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung 2000 \u2022 July 1982\n\nAudio Source:\nEcho And The Bunnymen \u2022 Show of Strength \u2022 From the album Heaven Up Here \u2022 Recorded at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth, Wales \u2022 March 1981 \u2022 Released May 30, 1981\n\nMusicians:\nIan McCulloch \u2022 vocals, guitar\nWill Sergeant \u2022 lead guitar\nLes Pattinson \u2022 bass\nPete de Freitas \u2022 drums\n\nHugh Jones \u2022 Production\n\n\u2022\n\nAlways more videos to follow, so please keep your electric eye on me babe! \n\nI don't own the rights, and I never monetize.

        "description": "Chase is an electronic instrumental by Giorgio Moroder from the Academy Award-winning soundtrack and album Midnight Express (1978), then extended and released as maxi single and made the Hot 100 singles charts in January of 1979, charting as high as #33.  Although originally branded as disco, the song is considered to be, along with Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\", a pioneer of the hi-NRG genre that came to prominence in the early 1980's.  The music was arranged by Giorgio Moroder with Harold Faltermeyer.\n\nGiovanni Giorgio Moroder is an influential Italian record producer, songwriter, performer and DJ. Moroder is frequently credited with pioneering synth disco and electronic dance music.\n \nWhen in Munich in the 1970s, he started his own record label called Oasis Records, which several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. He collaborated with Donna Summer during the era of disco (including \"Love to Love You Baby\" and \"I Feel Love\") and is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich, a recording studio used by many renowned artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Elton John.\n \nIn addition to producing several hits with Donna Summer, Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees, two albums for Sparks, a handful of songs on Bonnie Tyler's album Bitterblue as well as her 1985 single \"Here She Comes\" and a score of songs for performers including David Bowie, Irene Cara, Madleen Kane, Melissa Manchester, Blondie, Japan, and France Joli.\n\nMoroder made his first steps in music in the Scotch-Club in Aachen and then released a few singles under the name \"Giorgio\" beginning in 1966 after moving to Berlin, singing in Italian, Spanish, English, and German. He came to prominence in 1969, when his recording \"Looky Looky\", released on Ariola Records, was awarded a gold disc in October 1970. He then began making a name for himself in studios around Germany in the early 1970s. Often collaborating with lyricist Pete Bellotte, Moroder had a number of hits in his own name including \"Son of My Father\" in 1972, a No. 1 hit in Great Britain for Chicory Tip, before releasing the synthesizer-driven From Here to Eternity, a notable chartbuster in 1977. That same year he co-wrote and produced the seminal Donna Summer hit single I Feel Love. The following year he released \"Chase\", the theme from the film Midnight Express. \"Chase\" is often used on the American syndicated late night radio show \"Coast to Coast\" and was also used as an entrance theme for wrestling's group The Midnight Express. These songs achieved some chart success in the United Kingdom, the United States, and across Europe, and everywhere disco-mania was spreading. The full film score for Midnight Express won him his first Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1979. In 1979 Moroder released his album E=MC\u00b2. Text on the album's cover stated that it was the \"first electronic live-to-digital album.\" He also released three albums between 1977--1979 under the name Munich Machine.\n \nIn 1984, Moroder worked with Philip Oakey of The Human League to make the album Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder; which was a UK singles chart hit with \"Together in Electric Dreams\", title track to the 1984 film Electric Dreams. The same year saw him collaborating with Kajagoogoo frontman Limahl for their worldwide hit \"The NeverEnding Story\". In 1986, Moroder collaborated with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Harold Faltermeyer (of \"Axel F.\") and lyricist Tom Whitlock to create the score for the film Top Gun (1986) which included Kenny Loggins' hit \"Danger Zone\" and Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away\". He also wrote the theme song to the film Over the Top \"Meet Me Half Way\" which was also performed by Kenny Loggins. In 1987 Moroder produced and co-wrote Falco's song \"Body Next to Body\".\n\nIn 1980, he composed and produced two film soundtrack albums: the first for Foxes and the second for American Gigolo. A double album of the Foxes soundtrack was released on the disco label Casablanca Records which includes Donna Summer's hit single \"On the Radio\", which Moroder both produced and co-wrote. The Foxes soundtrack also contains a song titled Bad Love, written and performed by the singer-actress Cher and produced by Moroder. The American Gigolo soundtrack featured the Moroder-produced Blondie's \"Call Me\", a US and UK number one hit. All singles from the album also went to number two for five weeks on the disco/dance charts. In 1982 he wrote the soundtrack of the movie Cat People, including the hit single \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" featuring David Bowie.\n \nIn 1983, Moroder produced the soundtrack for the film Scarface. Notable Moroder-produced tracks included \"Scarface (Push It to the Limit)\" by Paul Engemann, \"Rush Rush\" by Debbie Harry, and \"She's on Fire\" by Amy Holland.",

In 1928 he arrived in London, after accepting an invitation from Fred Elizalde to join his band at the Savoy Hotel. Soon he was appearing with the bands of Roy Fox and Lew Stone, and became the favourite vocalist with Ray Noble, whom he followed to America in 1934, by which time he'd recorded 790 sides.  In 1937 he returned to England to continue his career.\nOn the evening of 16th April 1941, during World War II, Al arrived back in London, and entertained a friend at his apartment in Jermyn Street, in the city centre. After his friend had left, Al retired to bed to read, and fell asleep.  Hours later, during one of the heaviest German air raids of the war, a landmine fell and exploded, blowing in all the windows of the apartments in the area.  Al was found dead, lying next to his bed.",
